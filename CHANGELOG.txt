### Thu, 2010-09-23 17:30 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A14.B

Added/Fixed: (upgrade for all pre-A14.A required)

1.  Introducing default SSL Wildcard Nginx Proxy.
    Works for all sites/hostmaster instances on
    the same server and can be used also for
    encrypted connections to Chive and Collectd.
    Doesn't interfere even with SSL enabled sites
    on the same IP (with separate certs).

2.  The redirects are now back and enhanced.
    Fully compatible with Nginx in any combination
    with aliases and SSL settings/modes.

3.  Barracuda and Octopus by default installs still
    Aegir HEAD, but the latest alpha14 also works.

4.  Octopus can define its separate IP address
    if available.

5.  Fixed issue with too aggresive Hot Sauce check,
    causing creating not shared copies of code
    for platforms on every install or upgrade.

6.  Barracuda and Octopus now allows to skip DNS
    test, to make it possible to install on any
    virtualbox with dynamic DNS/IP etc. There is
    no guarantee it will work, but another switch
    is now available, if someone needs it.

7.  Octopus can now turn off local Memcache and Redis
    caches and switch all sites to use defined remote
    caches.

8.  Forced /etc/apt/sources.list rewrite also before
    the Barracuda system upgrade.

9.  Fix for the already installed and possibly broken
    git-core.

10. Fix for Aegir sites with .info domains, the path
    alias should now work without 403 error.


### Fri, 2010-09-17 11:00 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A14.A

Added/Fixed: (upgrade required)

1. Barracuda and Octopus by default installs now
   Aegir HEAD to use the fix for critical issue
   on sites import. It will be included in alpha14,
   please don't use alpha13.

2. Debian Lenny on 32bit systems works again.
   Fix for broken git-core after upgrade
   to version: 1:1.5.6.5-3+lenny3.1 on Lenny 32bit.

3. Fix and better inline warnings/info about
   missing locales at Linode and RackSpaceCloud.

4. More details in the installer log for better
   debugging and version tracking.

5. E-mail address for alerts on database repair
   started by auto-healing now correctly replaced.

6. Redis for Lenny now built from sources due to
   apt version moved already to Squeeze.

7. Critical bugfix for failed platforms install
   when hostmaster is not upgraded.

8. Introducing simple edition archive:
   http://omega8.cc/dev/bo-a14a.tar.gz

9. Octopus now better supports using newer shared
   code for platforms and introduces new setting:
   _HOT_SAUCE to allow forced fresh/hot code.


### Tue, 2010-09-12 21:50 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A13.A

Added/Fixed: (upgrade recommended)

1.  Octopus now creates SSH/FTPS separate, non-aegir
    account for every Aegir Satellite Instance,
    with limited shell to avoid using commands
    like "drush up" since they should never be used
    on sites managed in the Aegir system.

2.  Octopus now by default sends a welcome e-mail
    with some useful intro information and access
    details to the address defined as _CLIENT_EMAIL.

3.  When Octopus is used the first time to create
    an Aegir Satellite Instance, it doesn't allow
    to skip installing all platforms, since it is
    recommended to add all available platforms with
    initial install, for easier re-using the code
    by next Aegir Satellite Instances.

4.  The second and all future non-core Hostmaster
    installs allow to choose one or more platforms
    or to skip adding platforms at all.

5.  Octopus by default honors initial domain used
    for the Aegir Satellite Instance on every
    upgrade to avoid mistakes with using different
    copies of the script for different Aegir
    Satellite Instances upgrades.

6.  Also Barracuda will always honor initial
    domain used for the core Hostmaster to avoid
    mistakes on upgrade when you don't use
    the original version of the script.

7.  Better checks if the script is running as root.

8.  Removed memcache module since cache is used.

9.  SMTP connection test is now optional.

10. Nginx version set to 0.8.50.

11. By defult Aegir 0.4-HEAD instead of alpha13
    is now installed to fix critical issues with
    importing sites.

    See also: http://drupal.org/node/907248

12. Solr and Chive are now optional (Yes/no).

13. Added optional install of Collectd monitor.

14. Fixed issue with SSL mode.

15. Better compatibility for upgrades from
    pre-Barracuda Nginx installs.

16. Now it doesn't start cron before completing all
    install tasks to avoid breaking spinner.

17. Both Barracuda and Octopus now can better
    support re-starting stopped install/upgrade.

18. Octopus now refuses to run if defined domain
    doesn't resolve yet to the server IP address.

19. Octopus now refuses to run on system not
    created initially by Barracuda installer.

20. Custom FQDN hostname is now forced (if defined)
    in Barracuda before running DNS checks.

21. Fix for some missing mime types in vanilla Nginx.

22. Updated versions of Open Atrium, Drupal Commons
    and Cocomore Drupal distros installed by Octopus.

23. Lowered memory defaults in the MariaDB configuration.


### Tue, 2010-08-31 23:50 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A12.D

Added/Fixed: (upgrade recommended because it works!)

1. Upgrade of Aegir Master Instance by Barracuda
   and upgrade of Aegir Satellite Instances by Octopus
   finally works as expected.

2. It is now possible to use Barracuda to install
   environment and Aegir Master Instance, to
   upgrade only environment, to upgrade only Aegir
   Master Instance, or both at the same time.

3. Octopus now can separately install and/or upgrade
   any Aegir Satellite Instance or any platform
   on any instance, separately, using detailed prompt
   with version numbers and links to distributions
   home pages.

4. New platform Cocomore Drupal added in Octopus:
   http://drupal.cocomore.com


### Sat, 2010-08-28 20:15 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A12.C

Added/Fixed: (upgrade recommended)

1. By defult Aegir 0.4-HEAD with Drush 3.3
   is now installed to fix critical issues with
   importing sites. The fix is also available
   as a patch for alpha12:
   http://drupal.org/node/882970#comment-3382542

2. Both Barracuda and Octopus now allow to choose
   if the Aegir Hostmaster will be upgraded or not.

3. Added versions numbers and links to all platforms
   Yes/no prompts.

4. /tmp directory no longer used to avoid problems
   due to secure noexec mount.

5. Improved readme and docs (in progress).

6. Removed old, no longer supported installer.


### Fri, 2010-08-27 04:15 - Edition 0.4-alpha12-A12.B

Added/Fixed: (upgrade optional)

1. Octopus now allows to install or upgrade only Aegir
   Satellite Instance without any platforms added.

2. Enabled again early exit on the first error to avoid
   confusing cascade of errors if something went wrong.

3. Both Barracuda and Octopus runs now faster.
